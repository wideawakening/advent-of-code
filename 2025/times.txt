## day3
01:00 - 01:38               ; part1 easy if you figure out what the largest jolt is about

## day2
23:30  - 00:00 - 00:54       ; part1 easy
                             ; part2 is conceptually easy, but getting the function is bit more complex.
                             ; i ended using chatgpt and found a simple builtin generator

## day1
21:29 - 21:57 - 99:99        ; part1 easy, part2 still stuck on it despite several revies :(
                             ; solved part2 by simplifying
