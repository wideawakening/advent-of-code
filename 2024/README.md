## year tips/conditions

- samples and intermediate tests are ok for troubleshooting, but unless you need them go straight for final feedback ASAP
- using chatgpt is ok, as long as prompts are for  python helpers, not algorithms or general resolutions
- respect aoc rules on public repos; delete/encrypt inputs + don't put input solutions
