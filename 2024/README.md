## year learnings
- samples and intermediate tests are ok for troubleshooting or TDD practicing, but unless you need them, go straight for final result number. you will get it right many times and don't lose unnecessary time.
- something i did differently from previous years
 - on map/2D quizzes, evaluate if you need the actual matrix, or it's ok to just have the key info for getting the result.
   ex.: on day6, having a map with the .,#,X with point tuples is enough

## howto
- using chatgpt is ok, as long as prompts are for  python helpers, not algorithms or general resolutions
- respect aoc rules on public repos; delete/encrypt inputs + don't put input solutions
- left my resolution [times](./times.txt) and comments for fun. may contain spoilers
