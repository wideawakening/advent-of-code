## day5
19:00 - 19:47 - 20:27               ; part1, easy. breaking up functions makes you see things clearly indeed :) used chatgpt for file reading and structure generation
                                    ; part2, easy but had to think a bit requirements.
                                    ; the day i enjoyed the most so far

## day4
19:20   - 20:25 - 21:36            ; part1, i could do it manually but was lazy and ask chagpt, it was even worse since my prompt was not specific enough and we got several misunderstanding (ex.: what a diagonal was :faceplam:) anyway... got it working after some fixings.
                                   ; part2,  made it from scratch. much simpler than part1, until you realize you don't know python nor the fact that matrix overflows to the end with negative index :yolo:
## day3
20:06   - 20:25 - 22:07     ; part1 easy, part 2 tried to do it just with a regexp with ahead/behind negative/positive lookahead but did not make it work. went for some state machine

## day2
20:45 - 21:21 - n/a         ; part1 easy, part2 i complicated it too much, want to redo it sometime
                            ; (day5) part2 pff i think i overcomplicated it too much but did some dirty code and worked. enough for the day!
## day1
21:15 - 21:57 -22:06        ; easy, it ain't much but it's honest work xD
