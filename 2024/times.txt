## day9

21:25 - *                               ; part1, sample ok, input not. checking options, possibly id going over 9 and no being handled as a single digit
                                        ; part1, ok, gave it another go next day and being bit smart i could simplify all the process :) regexp out and string manipulation out, it's enough with a list
## day8

16:55 - 18:40 - 20:43(w/break)        ; part1, tough, 2D map positions. need to check later how people optimize this to be less messy with all the cases
                                      ; part2, i went bananas before i re-read the challenge, specifically " including the antinodes that appear on every antenna"... :facepalm: some dinner in between did me good
                                      ; on both parts, once sample worked, input worked too, that's unusual but niceee :-)

## day7

20:20 - 20:53 - 21:50               ; part1, recursive easy
                                    ; part2, recursive, easy :-) i was not covering something trivial and got me time to figure it out. as always, reddit gave the hint. thanks community!



## day6
16:41 - *  - KO                     ; part1 seemed easy but was not able to get to result. i brute-forced it by doing -1  couple of times; must be some edge-case. just got lucky. went to see LOTR war of the rohirrim in between
                                    ; part1, discovered what was wrong.. the initial rows/cols value setup  i did a +1 instead of -1 (starting from 0) deity knows why   -__________-

## day5
19:00 - 19:47 - 20:27               ; part1, easy. breaking up functions makes you see things clearly indeed :) used chatgpt for file reading and structure generation
                                    ; part2, easy but had to think a bit requirements.
                                    ; the day i enjoyed the most so far

## day4
19:20   - 20:25 - 21:36            ; part1, i could do it manually but was lazy and ask chagpt, it was even worse since my prompt was not specific enough and we got several misunderstanding (ex.: what a diagonal was :faceplam:) anyway... got it working after some fixings.
                                   ; part2,  made it from scratch. much simpler than part1, until you realize you don't know python nor the fact that matrix overflows to the end with negative index :yolo:
## day3
20:06   - 20:25 - 22:07     ; part1 easy, part 2 tried to do it just with a regexp with ahead/behind negative/positive lookahead but did not make it work. went for some state machine

## day2
20:45 - 21:21 - n/a         ; part1 easy, part2 i complicated it too much, want to redo it sometime
                            ; (day5) part2 pff i think i overcomplicated it too much but did some dirty code and worked. enough for the day!
## day1
21:15 - 21:57 -22:06        ; easy, it ain't much but it's honest work xD
