## day3
20:06   - 20:25 - 22:07     ; part1 easy, part 2 tried to do it just with a regexp with ahead/behind negative/positive lookahead but did not make it work. went for some state machine

## day2
20:45 - 21:21 - n/a         ; part1 easy, part2 i complicated it too much, want to redo it sometime

## day1
21:15 - 21:57 -22:06        ; easy, it ain't much but it's honest work xD
